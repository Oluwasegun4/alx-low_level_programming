# 0x06 - More Pointers, Arrays and Strings

## This directory contains codes to functions about pointers, arrays and strings

## Tasks

- Write a function that concatenates two strings.

- Write a function that concatenates two strings. - The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
it will use at most n bytes from src; and src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes

- Write a function that copies a string.

- Write a function that compares two strings.

- Write a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.

- Write a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

- Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string.

- Write a function that encodes a string into 1337.

- Write a function that encodes a string using rot13.

- Write a function that prints an integer.

- Add one line to this code, so that the program prints a[2] = 98, followed by a new line.

- Write a function that adds two numbers.

- Write a function that prints a buffer.

## My thoughts

It was such a nice time trying to understand how pointers, arrays and strings work with these tasks.
